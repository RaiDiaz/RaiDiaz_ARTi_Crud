# RaiDiaz_ARTi_Crud
I have problem to upload the API project, The project was created in Visual Studio 2022 (latest version).
In the project I have two independent prpject. One for the rest API and the other for the front-end.
I'm trying to solve this issue (resolved)
The project is like the video.

When you open the project the API folder will appear inside RaiDiaz_ARTi_Crud-main folder, you must move outside the folder "RaiDiaz_ARTi_Crud-main", with this you would not have any problem when you open the project.

RaiDiaz_ARTi_Crud-main folder you only have to click the .sln file.
